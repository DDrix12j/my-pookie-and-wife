💭 Why I Made This
To express what can’t always be said with words.
To give something lasting and meaningful.
To show how much she means to me — through something I know: code.
and also to improve my capability and my skills on coding

This is more than a website.
It’s a digital scrapbook, a love letter, and a promise.
